# Citizens of Rome: Dynasty Ascendant Mods
This repo contains all of the mods I've made for Citizens of Rome: Dynasty Ascendant.

For mod support, see:

https://rome.rangergo.net/modding-support/

The TLDR; is, find the "mods" folder for your OS, and unzip any of my mods into that folder.

Windows: ~/documents/CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods

iOS: Documents/CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods

Android: /CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods

The mods folder is also displayed in the "Settings" view of the game after you click "Enable Mods." In order to reload your mods in-game, you can simply disable and then re-enable mod support in Settings view.

These mods are totally free. Use them. Copy them. Claim they're yours ... I don't care ;). Hit me up in the [CoR discord](https://discord.gg/ZVkxjC5) for questions, feature requests, etc.
